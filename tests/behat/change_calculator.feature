  @javascript
  Scenario: Teachers can change the calculator before grades are released
    Given I am on the "Test peerwork name" "peerwork activity editing" page logged in as teacher1
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then I can change the calculator before grades are released

  @javascript
  Scenario: Teachers must agree to regrade students if the calculator changes after grades are released
    Given I am on the "Test peerwork name" "peerwork activity" page logged in as teacher1
    And I press "Release all grades for all groups"
    And I navigate to "Settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then I can change the calculator after grades are released
