  Scenario: Teachers can clear submissions
    Given I am on the "Test peerwork name" "peerwork activity" page logged in as teacher1
    And I follow "Group 1"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then I should see "empty.txt" in the "Peer submission and grades" "fieldset"
    And "Student 3" row "Student 1" column of "Criteria 1" table should contain "1"
    And the following should exist in the "justificationbyforstudent2" table:
      | -1-       | -2-      |
      | Student 0 | Poor     |
      | Student 1 | Did well |
      | Student 3 | Exceeded |
    And I follow "Peer Assessment"
    And I press "Clear all submissions"
    And I click on "Yes" "button" in the "Confirmation" "dialogue"
    And I follow "Group 1"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then I should see "Nothing submitted yet" in the "Peer submission and grades" "fieldset"
    And "Student 3" row "Student 1" column of "Criteria 1" table should contain "-"
    And the following should exist in the "justificationbyforstudent2" table:
